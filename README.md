In these two screenshot, we have the left section of the main webpage:-

    The left section was created using <iframe> tag, which creates a frame and we can display other webpages or part of a webpage inside it.
    Inside the <iframe> I have used width, height and src attributes:
        "width" to adjust the width of the frame.
        "height" to adjust the height of the frame.
        "src" holds the link or the path to the webpage which will be displayed in this left frame.

        For the webpage which is displayed inside this left frame, I have created a different file:
              firstly all the necessary tags like <html>, <head>, <body> are used and inside the body tag, the main content begins.

              I have created 4 projects, all 4 of them are created with the same tags and steps.

              The heading of the project is written by using <p> paragraph tag.
              Then the img part is actually a hyperlink which is created using <a> anchor tag and the src attribute holds the link to the webpage which leads to a different webpage, and this webpage will be shown on the right section or the right side frame of the main page. The img inside the anchor tag is created using the <img> tag. It also contains a target attribute which contains the location where the attached link will be displayed at.
              Then a <hr> horizontal rule tag is used to draw a horizontal line across the width of the frame. and then a <br> tag to give some space between the elements. 

              These steps are repeated 4 times to create these 4 projects sections.

In this screenshot, the right section of the main page is displayed:-

      This section or frame is also created using the <iframe> tag and src attribute holds the link to the webpage which is to be displayed inside this frame. When the main page is opened, the right frame won't be empty because the src attribute hold the link which is being displayed.  It also holds another attribute named "name" which basically gives it a name or identity, which can be used in anchor tags to redirect webpages to this frame or section of the webpage.

      Similarly, when any image hyperlink is clicked on the left frame, the redirected webpage will be displayed on the right frame because the target is set to this right frame.
